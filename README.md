# Fraction-Calculator
GUI Fraction Calculator created in Microsoft Visual Studio in C#

This was my first experience working with Visual Studio or designing a GUI interface! 
The code was sourced from a Java project I had completed earlier that was designed to run in
a console. I converted it to C# as practice in that language, then built the GUI version based off of that.

With limited experience with VS, I had a little difficulty getting my buttons to function properly, but by the 
end I felt much more comfortable with the software; all in all, this was a good experience to build off of!
